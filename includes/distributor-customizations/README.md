This folder holds the tweaks we do to the Distributor plugin.

They are active in the Hub and in all Nodes of the network, either by default, or dependning on some option that is set on the Hub and propagated to the Nodes.

# Global tweaks

These are the changes we apply to Distributor in all sites:

* Post publication date: When you push or pull a post, the publication date is kept in the target site, instead of updating it to the distribution date.
